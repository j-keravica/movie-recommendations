## Movie Recommendations

This repository contains collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm
written in Matlab applied to the [small MovieLens
dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).

I have used some of the existing code from Coursera Machine Learning course. I
decided I want to use the MovieLens dataset, because it contains all the latest
movies and I wanted to try it out myself. The dataset has been tidied up - I
have generated new movie IDs to remove gaps and updated the corresponding
ratings so I can use them in Matlab more easily.
